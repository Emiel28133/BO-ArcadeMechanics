2D platformer using 3d models, the camera follows the player. the player can only walk right and left using the a (left) and d (right) buttons and can jump using the space button. he can jump from platform to platform that aren't connected and are floating with a background. on the platforms he can find coins of a yellow/gold colour, kinda like a bitcoin. on collision with the coin it dissapears and 1 point gets added to the counter. also when you pickup a coin, that becomes your checkpoint. if you die by falling off a platform or getting killed by an enemy you respown at the place you picked up the coin.
